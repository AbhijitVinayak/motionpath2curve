Convert Motion Path of an animated object in Blender to a Bezier Curve

**Installation:**
Cmonnnnn! If you're converting a motion path to a curve, I'm assuming you already know how to install an addon

**Usage:**
The button will be available in the Object Properties/Motion Paths Section
Steps:
1. Calculate the motion path of the animated asset
2. Click Convert to Curve, Yay
